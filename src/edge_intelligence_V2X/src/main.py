CARLA Vehicle Spawn with Pygame Display & Plotting (sd_3/__main__.py)

This script connects to CARLA, spawns a vehicle, applies constant
forward throttle, and visualizes the simulation using:
1. PygameDisplay: Shows a rigidly attached camera view in a Pygame window.
2. Plotter: Plots the vehicle's X-coordinate and speed vs. time using Matplotlib.

It also sets the initial spectator camera position to a fixed viewpoint.

Dependencies:
- tools.pygame_display (Specifically the PygameDisplay class)
- tools.plotter_x (Specifically the Plotter class for X-coord/Speed plots)
